The mod idea is that it will resemple the original Tiberain Dawn, every thing that is EXTRA will and should be added as an option and set off by default. Any feature that can't be duplicated exactly it will need to be at least close to the originalas possible.

 ### Any one willing to help is welcome to do so!
